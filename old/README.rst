PKGBUILD
========

This repo contains PKGBUILD files for various apps or libraries for Archlinux
I have likely made a new PKGBUILD to add features or to install an application
that doesn't exist within AUR.

* Archlinux - `Archlinux <https://www.archlinux.com>`_


vim-pybuild
-----------

Customised vim build which includes extra make options for using python

* Vim - `Vim <http://www.vim.org/>`_


google-chrome-dev
-----------------

(no longer used as switched to chromium)

Latest dev build of google chrome

* Chrome Release Blog - `<http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/search/label/Dev%20updates>`_


evince2-light
-------------

Because evince3 is ugly (rounded corners? + no page preview sidebar?)

Also custom build with new patch to fix compile errors

python2-pcapy
-------------

* python2-pcapy - `pcapy <http://www.coresecurity.com/corelabs-research/open-source-tools/pcapy>`_

This is a dependancy of ooni-probe by torproject
